This note provides the instructions on how to perform controlled flights on
 SoftFly using Simulink Desktop Real-Time system.

"step1_setup" is to set all the required parameter for performing flights. 
- It calls functions inside the "function" folder to get struct like ctr, 
rbt, mdl ish for the simulink model. 
- rsim.en decide whether to run in simulation (Simulink in normal mode) or 
compiled Simulink Desktop Real-Time (C code).

"build_controller" indicates the flight time (in sec), connects the target meachine (SpeedGoat), and builds (compiles) the Simulink model on the target machine.

"setparam" loads the model (with pre-defined mdlName), sets (updates) those frequently-used parameters on the target machine.

"run_controller" starts the controller (usually within 2-sec), saves the logFiles in "data", starts the "forced_stop" model if TargetError occurs. 

"save_file" saves the current data in the "Flight" folder in the D Drive alongside with the video.

"analysis" shows plots of the latest flight data. If you want to investigate previous flights, just load previous flight data and run this script.
